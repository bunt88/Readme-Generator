# Professional README Generator

As a developer I want to create an appliation that can generate a README file with generated prompts and user entered responses.



To use the application, you will need to load it into the terminal and answer the prompts.

A README file will then be generated using your given responses to the prompts.

The generated README will ask for the following prompts:
    
    - Project Title
    - Description
    - How to Install
    - How to Use
    - How others can contribute
    - How the project can be tested
    - what licenses were used given a set of options
    - Users GitHub account
    - Users Email address

Using the following infomration, a Professional README file will be generated
